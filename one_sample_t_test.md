# When to use?
- when we want to compare the mean of a sample to a known population mean
- less than 30
- when you don't know population stdev

# key conditions
- random sample
- independence
- normality - sample >= 30 can by pass but in this case you can use Z test

WHat is degrees of freedom?
- if I ask you to select 3 numbers which is average is 60, you have freedom to select 2 numbers freely, but last number should satisfy the condition.
